# Workflow: Commit Guard

# Description:
# This workflow acts as a safety net for failed deployments. If a deployment to 
# a branch goes wrong, this workflow is designed to automatically detect the issue, 
# revert the problematic commit, and notify the relevant teams. This ensures that 
# branches remain stable and that issues are quickly addressed.

# Triggers:
# This workflow is activated upon the completion of various specified workflows. 
# It checks for failures and acts accordingly.

# Logical Flow:
# 1.  It retrieves the problematic SHA from a Gist.
# 2.  Checks out the repository at that SHA.
# 3.  Validates the checkout.
# 4.  Determines which deployment caused the problem.
# 5.  Retrieves the last known good commit SHA from a lock file.
# 6.  Resets the repository to that good commit.
# 7.  Pushes the changes to revert the problematic commit.
# 8.  Deletes the latest tag that might have been created by the problematic commit (both locally and remotely).
# 9.  Notifies the relevant teams and the committer of the problem.
# 10. A catch-all step exists to handle any unexpected errors, ensuring that 
#     the workflow always has a defined outcome.
