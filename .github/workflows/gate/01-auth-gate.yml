name: "Authentication Gateway"

#  ${{ github.workflow }} Overview
#
#  Brief Description:
#  This workflow is responsible for authenticating users based on their commit 
#  details, ensuring that the commit author belongs to an approved team for 
#  the specific branch they're pushing to. It also manages GitHub API rate 
#  limits and ensures that only one instance of this workflow runs at a time 
#  for concurrency management. If the authentication is successful, it triggers 
#  the next workflow.
#
#  Steps 'authenticate-user' job:
#  1 - Sanitize Untrusted User-Controlled Details from Payload: Cleans up 
#      user-controlled details to prevent any potential security threats.
#  2 - Validate Committer: Ensures the commit author is part of the approved 
#      team for the respective branch.
#
# Steps 'instigate-workflows' job:
#  3 - Check Concurrency: Ensures only this instance of any workflow is running.
#  4 - Trigger Next Workflow: If previous steps are successful, dispatch the next workflow.
#
# Exit Codes:
# 10 - Branch name is not recognised.
# 11 - Approved team not set.
# 12 - User is not authorised.
# 90 - Concurrency failure.
# 91 - Failed to trigger next workflow.
