To reset your local environment, delete and reclone https://github.com/CodeApprover/Blazor-SqLite-DevOps.git

To reset your environment, you can also execute scripts\sparse_checkout_env.bat
This resets the main branch to exactly reflect the remote main
It also creates three clean branches: code-development, code-staging, code-production

Sample command: scripts\sparse_checkout_env.bat development

Commit your changes locally in the "code-development" branch.
Push your changes to a new branch on the remote repository using a different name (e.g., "john-doe-3241"):

git push origin code-development:feature/john-doe-3241

Go to the repository on GitHub and create a pull request from your newly pushed branch john-doe-3241 into the "code-development" branch.
Request a code review from the appropriate collaborators.

Once the pull request is approved, it will be merged into the "code-development" branch automatically.

This way, your changes will be subject to review, and they will be merged into the protected branch only after the review process is complete and the pull request is approved.
