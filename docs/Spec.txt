ASP.NET Assignment2:

Golf Club DB
Due date: March 7th 2023

For this assignment, you are requested to write a small web site
for a local golf club using ASP.NET

1.  Using either Razor or Blazor the user of the system should be able to:
            Create
            Read
            Update
            Delete
                golfers details from the database.

2.  The clubâ€™s members are stored with:
            membership number
            name
            email
            gender
            handicap
                for each player.

3.  The system should also allow players to book tee times:
            Tee time bookings are made in 15 minutes intervals
            from the beginning of the hour e.g 9:00, 9:15, 9:30 and 9:45.

            Only four players may play at the same tee time -
                The tee timetable should store:
                    player one, player two, player three and player four names
                        along with their handicaps.

4.  Members are not permitted to book two games on the one day.

5.  From the browser users should be allowed to query the database on the following:
            Member gender
            Handicap golfers below 10
            Handicap golfers between 11 and 20
            Handicap golfers above 20
            All bookings for a selected member
            Sort :
                Members by Name ascending descending order,
                Members by Handicap number ascending-descending.

6.  Use the SQLite database for storing members and booking details.

7.  Demonstrate validation of input at
            server side,
            client side.
