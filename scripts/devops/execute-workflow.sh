#!/bin/bash

# This script automates the process of updating and pushing changes to specific branches.
# It performs the following tasks:
# 1. Verifies the directory from which it is run.
# 2. Accepts a branch name as an argument.
# 3. Updates the 'workflow.driver' file with predefined content.
# 4. Commits the updated file to the specified branch multiple times at a defined interval.
# 5. Offers branch-specific directory selection for the 'main' branch.
# 6. Restores the git environment after execution.

# Exit Code Comments:
# 1: Incorrect script execution directory
# 2: Incorrect usage or missing argument
# 3: Invalid branch name as argument
# 4: User canceled the operation after being warned about the effects of the script
# 5: User canceled during directory selection for the 'main' branch

# set -x    # Print all commands for debugging
set -e      # Exit if any command fails

# Check if the script is being run from the correct directory
