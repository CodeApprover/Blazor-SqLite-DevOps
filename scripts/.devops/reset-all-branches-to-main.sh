WARNING_MESSAGE=$(cat << EOM

CAUTION:

This script automates the recreation of
code-development, code-staging and code-production branches
using main as the source.

The script assumes that required users have the necessary permissions.

It performs the following tasks:

    1. Checkout and update of the main branch.
    2. DELETE all local and remote branches except 'main'.
    3. Create and setup fresh branches named 'code-development', 'code-staging' and 'code-production' based on 'main'.
    4. Ensure that each code- branch only has its specific required directories and files.
    5. Returns to the main branch.

Consequences:

    1. Any unmerged changes in deleted branches will be LOST FOREVER.
    2. The deleted branches on the remote could impact other collaborators' work.
    3. The operations are irreversible. Ensure you have a backup if needed.
    4. All stashes will be dropped and lost.
Exit Codes:

    0. Script executed successfully without errors.
    1. User chose to exit the script without making changes.
    2. Production directory not found in the parent directory.
    3. Staging directory not found in the parent directory.
    4. Scripts directory not found in the parent directory.
    5. Development directory not found in the specified search path.
