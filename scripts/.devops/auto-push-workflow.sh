CAUTION:

This script automates pushing workflow.driver changes to a specific branch
and assumes that required users have the necessary permissions.

It performs the following tasks:

    1. Verifies the directory from which it is run.
    2. Accepts a branch name as an argument.
    3. Updates the 'workflow.driver' file with predefined content.
    4. Commits the updated file to the specified branch multiple times at a defined interval.
    5. Offers branch-specific directory selection for the 'main' branch.
    6. Restores the git environment after execution.

Consequences:

    1. The script will automate git operations that may affect the repository's branches and files.
    2. Incorrect usage or misconfiguration can lead to unexpected changes and loss of data.
    3. Use with caution and ensure you have backup copies of important files.

Exit Codes:

    0. Script executed successfully without errors.
    1. Incorrect script execution directory.
    2. Incorrect usage or missing argument.
    3. Invalid branch name as argument.
    4. User cancelled the operation after warning message.
    5. User cancelled during directory selection for the main branch.
